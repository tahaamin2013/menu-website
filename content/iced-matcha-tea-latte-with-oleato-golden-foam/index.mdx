Hey there, matcha lovers and curious coffee shop explorers! Have you heard about the latest buzz at Starbucks? It's the Iced Matcha Tea Latte with Oleato Golden Foam™, and it's taking the green tea game to a whole new level!
Imagine this: smooth, creamy matcha sweetened just right, chilling out with milk over ice. But wait, there's more! The star of the show is the lush Oleato Golden Foam™ on top. It's like the cool cousin of whipped cream, infused with Partanna® extra virgin olive oil. Yep, you heard that right – olive oil in your drink!
Let's break down this green machine:
- Matcha tea blend (sugar + ground green tea)
- Milk of your choice
- Ice (because, duh, it's iced!)
- The famous Oleato Golden Foam™ (vanilla sweet cream + extra virgin olive oil)
Starbucks is all about customization, so here's how to make this drink uniquely yours:
1. Choose your milk:
- Whole milk for extra creaminess
- Non-fat for a lighter sip
- Plant-based? Go for almond, coconut, oat, or soy
2. Adjust your matcha intensity:
- Matcha scoops range from 1 to 12 (whoa, matcha madness!)
3. Ice, ice, baby:
- Regular ice, extra ice, light ice, or no ice (but why?)

**This drink is perfect for: **
- Matcha enthusiasts looking for a new twist
- Health-conscious folks who love a treat
- Anyone curious about the Oleato craze
- Iced tea fans ready to level up their game
**When to Enjoy This Olive Oil-Infused Wonder**

Honestly? Anytime! But here are some prime sipping occasions:
- As a refreshing afternoon pick-me-up
- During a sunny weekend brunch
- As a post-workout treat (hello, antioxidants!)
- Whenever you need a little luxury in your day

Let's talk nutrition. A Grande (16 fl oz) of this green goddess packs:
- 410 calories
- 30g sugar
- 28g fat
Yeah, it's not exactly a diet drink, but remember, the Oleato Golden Foam™ is what bumps up those numbers. It's all about balance, right?

**Why You'll Love It**
- It's a fresh take on the classic Starbucks iced matcha tea latte
