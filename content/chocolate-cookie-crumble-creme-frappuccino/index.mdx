When should you grab one? Anytime you need a pick-me-up! It's great for a hot summer day, an afternoon snack, or just because you want something sweet.
Want to make it your own? You've got lots of choices:
1. Pick your milk: From whole milk to almond milk, there's an option for everyone.
2. Add more chips: You can get up to 12 scoops of Frappuccino chips!
3. Pump up the mocha: Like it extra chocolatey? Add more mocha sauce.
4. Cookie crazy: Ask for extra cookie crumbles on top.

But watch out! This drink is a treat, not a health food. Its tall 12 fl oz cup has about 330 calories, 33g of sugar, and 18g of fat. Enjoy it as a special indulgence!
