## Coffee Traveler - Decaf Pike Place Roast

Starbucks Caffè Mocha is a classic coffee drink; it always delights with its sweet flavour.

> - full-bodied Signature Espresso Roast,
> - bittersweet mocha sauce and
> - steamed hot 2% milk
>
> It's then topped with a thick, frothy layer of milk foam and sweetened whipped cream.

The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and caramel-flavoured. The mocha sauce is a mix of chocolate syrup and coffee. The number of espresso shots and mocha sauce pumps varies depending on the drink size.
