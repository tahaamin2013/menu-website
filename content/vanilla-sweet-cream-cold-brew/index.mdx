## Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew 
  
With Starbucks Cappuccino, you can start your day with an energising, balanced coffee. Its strong espresso flavour and creamy texture can boost students' caffeine during their study time. Office workers can also enjoy its rich taste to recharge and work better. 

The standard recipe includes Signature Espresso Roast, steamed hot 2% milk with a thick, frothy layer of milk foam on top of the Cappuccino.

The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and has a caramel flavour. The standard number of espresso shots depends on the size of the drink:

<div style={{width:"300px"}}>
| Size    |  Volume      | Standard Espresso Shots |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| Short   | 8 fl oz      | 1                       |
| Tall    | 12 fl oz     | 1                       |
| Grande  | 16 fl oz     | 2                       |
| Venti   | 20 fl oz     | 2                       |
</div>

If you like a smooth, vibrant, and slightly citrusy taste, you can customize your drink by choosing Blonde Espresso Roast.

If you don't like Signature or Blonde Espresso Roast, you can choose one of the following:

 - ⅓ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ½ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ⅔ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - Decaf Espresso Roast

You can also customise the number of shots for any size, up to a maximum of 12 shots.

Starbucks uses steamed hot milk in its standard Cappuccino. The company also offers warm milk for those who prefer it, and they can make it extra hot upon request.

Regular whole milk typically contains 3.25% fat. Although Starbucks provides 2% fat milk in its standard Cappuccino, you may choose whole or non-fat milk.

Apart from the above, various non-dairy alternatives are also available:
 - almond
 - coconut
 - oat milk and
 - soy

 For those who prefer richer or alternative tastes, Starbucks also provides options like:

- heavy cream,
- non-dairy vanilla sweet cream,
- vanilla sweet cream, and
- breve (half & half).
