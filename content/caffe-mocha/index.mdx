## Caffè Mocha

Starbucks Caffè Mocha is a classic coffee drink; it always delights with its sweet flavour.

> The standard recipe includes
> - full-bodied Signature Espresso Roast,
> - bittersweet mocha sauce and
> - steamed hot 2% milk
>
> It's then topped with a thick, frothy layer of milk foam and sweetened whipped cream.
