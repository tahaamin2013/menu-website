## Caffè Latte 

> Love [Starbucks Cappuccino](https://starbmenu.com/hot-coffees/cappuccino)? Try the Caffè Latte next. It's softer, smoother, and milkier than a Cappuccino. The Latte has the same ingredients as a Cappuccino—coffee, milk, and foam—but it uses more milk and less foam.

Caffè Latte is a perfect milk-forward warm-up. It's great for calm breaks or soft energy boosts. You can enjoy it while relaxing, working, or meeting friends.

> The standard Latte has three parts:
> 
> 1. There's strong signature espresso roast coffee.
> 2. They add 2% steamed hot milk.
> 3. They put a thin layer of milk foam on top.

The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and has a caramel flavour. The standard number of espresso shots depends on the size of the drink:

| Size    |  Volume      | Standard Espresso Shots |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| Short   | 8 fl oz      | 1                       |
| Tall    | 12 fl oz     | 1                       |
| Grande  | 16 fl oz     | 2                       |
| Venti   | 20 fl oz     | 2                       |
</div>

You can pick a lighter coffee if you want. It's called Blonde Espresso Roast. It tastes smooth and a bit like citrus.

If you don't want much caffeine, you can get decaf. Starbucks has full decaf or part decaf.
You can choose how much decaf you want in your drink as follows:

 - ⅓ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ½ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ⅔ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - Decaf Espresso Roast

You can also customise the number of shots for any size, up to a maximum of 12 shots.

Starbucks uses steamed hot milk in its standard Caffè Latte. The company also offers warm milk for those who prefer it, and they can make it extra hot upon request.

Regular whole milk typically contains 3.25% fat. Although Starbucks provides 2% fat milk in its standard Caffè Latte, you may choose whole or non-fat milk.

Apart from the above, various non-dairy alternatives are also available:
 - almond
 - coconut
 - oat milk and
 - soy

 For those who prefer richer or alternative tastes, Starbucks also provides options like:

- heavy cream,
- non-dairy vanilla sweet cream,
- vanilla sweet cream, and
- breve (half & half).

You can change the thin layer of milk foam on top of Caffe Latte if you want. You can ask for no foam at all. Or you can ask for a little foam. You can even ask for extra foam. It's up to you how much foam you want on your drink.
