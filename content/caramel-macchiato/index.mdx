## Caramel Macchiato 

  If you love lattes, you should try a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks. Due to its sweet taste, it is the cool cousin of [latte](https://starbmenu.com/hot-coffees/caffe-latte). It gives a stronger first sip because it uses less milk than a regular latte. Don't worry, though—it's still creamy and smooth.

> The standard Caramel Macchiato has four parts:
> 1. There's strong signature espresso roast coffee.
> 2. They add 2% steamed hot milk mixed with vanilla syrup.
> 3. They put a thin layer of milk foam on top. It's more than a Latte has but less than a Cappuccino. 
> 4. They drizzle sweet caramel on top.
> 

As you drink, the flavours blend into a tasty mix. It's not as milky as a latte but sweeter than a [cappuccino](https://starbmenu.com/hot-coffees/cappuccino).


The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and caramel-flavoured. The white chocolate mocha sauce mixes sugar, water, natural flavours, potassium sorbate, and citric acid. The number of espresso shots and vanilla syrup pumps varies depending on the drink size.
