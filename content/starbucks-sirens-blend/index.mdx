## Starbucks Siren's Blend 
  
Want to make Starbucks coffee at home? Looking for a special gift? Try the Starbucks Siren's Blend. This coffee is more than just tasty. It has a story to tell.

Look at the Starbucks logo. You'll see a woman with a fishtail. She's not a mermaidâ€”she's a Siren from old Greek tales. Starbucks picked her as its symbol.

"Starbucks Siren's Blend" is a mix of coffee from Africa and South America. It tastes like fruit, lemon, and chocolate. Talented women in the coffee world made this blend.

The name 'Siren' in this coffee blend is a nod to women who work with coffee, a way to say "thank you" to them.
