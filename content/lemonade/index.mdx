## Lemonade 
  
  Hey there, lemonade lovers! Ever had one of those days when life gives you lemons? Well, forget about making lemonade yourself - Starbucks has got you covered!

You might be thinking, "It's just lemonade, right?" Wrong! This isn't your grandma's lemonade or the stuff from that lemonade stand where a duck might waddle up. This is Starbucks Lemonade we're talking about!
1. It's super refreshing
2. Perfect for any time of day
3. Customizable (because you're the boss!)

It's simple and delicious:
- Water (duh!)
- Lemon juice (fresh and tangy)
- Sugar (just enough to make you smile)
- Lemon oil (for that extra oomph!)
And don't forget the ice - you can have it normal, light, extra, or none at all. It's your world!

Unlike that one-hit-wonder band Lemonade Mouth, Starbucks lets you be the star. Want it sweeter? Just ask! Prefer it tart? They've got you!

When to Grab This Citrus Sensation
- Feeling hot? Lemonade time!
- Need a pick-me-up? Lemonade to the rescue!
- Just because? Yep, lemonade works for that, too!

For all you calorie counters out there, a Grande (that's 16 oz for non-Starbucks speakers) has:
- 120 calories
- 27g sugar
- 0g fat
Not bad for a treat that feels like a cheat!

Ever wondered about pink lemonade? It's not from pink lemons (sorry to burst your bubble). It's usually regular lemonade with added fruity flavors or colors. But stick with Starbucks' classic - it's a real crowd-pleaser!

So next time you're at Starbucks and can't decide what to get, why not give their lemonade a shot? It's not as strong as Mike's Hard Lemonade (which is about 5% alcohol, by the way), but it's 100% delicious!

Remember, when life gives you lemons, forget the hassle of making lemonade yourself. Just head to Starbucks and let them do the work for you!

Now, who's thirsty?
