The baguette is nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The ham and Swiss cheese make a classic combo that never gets old. And that Dijon mustard butter? It adds just the right kick!

Starbucks uses good ingredients, too. The baguette is made with unbleached flour. The ham has no added nitrates or nitrites - just natural stuff from celery powder. And the Swiss cheese is made from part-skim milk, so it's not too heavy.

Now, let's talk calories. This sandwich packs 500 calories, with 24 grams of fat and just 1 gram of sugar. It's filling without being too sweet. Plus, it's high in protein, which helps keep you full longer.
