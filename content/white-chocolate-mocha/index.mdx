## White Chocolate Mocha 
  
If you are obsessed with sweets but don't like coffee, White hot Chocolate is for you. Unlike regular [hot chocolate](https://starbucks-menu-with-prices.net/milk-juice-and-more/hot-chocolate), kids also like it because it contains cocoa and is caffeine-free. 

It's a traditional hot chocolate beverage. You can drink it anytime! But it's extra nice when it's cold outside. It's the perfect way to warm up after a long day.

It is made with white chocolate mocha sauce and 2% steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and milk foam.

The number of mocha sauce pumps varies depending on the drink size.
