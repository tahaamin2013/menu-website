## French Press 

  Want to make cafe-quality coffee at home? The Starbucks French Press is your ticket to rich, flavorful brews. Let's dive into how to use this coffee maker and why it's a game-changer for coffee lovers.

A French Press is a simple yet effective coffee brewing device. The Starbucks version features:
- A plastic carafe with a Tritan liner
- A matte black finish
- Dual filters for smoother coffee
- Dishwasher-safe parts

French Press coffee is known for its:
- Full-bodied flavor
- Rich taste
- Ease of use
- Affordability

How to Use Your Starbucks French Press

1. Measure your coffee: Use about 2 tablespoons per 8 ounces of water.
2. Boil water and let it cool slightly (about 200°F is ideal).
3. Add coffee grounds to the press.
4. Pour in hot water and stir gently.
5. Place the lid on top, but don't press down.
6. Wait 4 minutes for the coffee to steep.
7. Slowly press the plunger down.
8. Pour and enjoy!

For the perfect brew, try a 1:15 ratio of coffee to water. This means:
- 1 ounce (28 grams) of coffee for every 15 ounces (450 ml) of water
- Adjust to taste – some prefer a stronger 1:12 ratio

The ideal steeping time is 4 minutes. But you can experiment:
- 3 minutes for a lighter taste
- 5 minutes for a stronger brew
- Don't go over 6 minutes to avoid bitterness

French Press Tips and Tricks
- Use coarse-ground coffee for best results
- Preheat your press with hot water before brewing
- Don't press too hard – gentle pressure is all you need
- Serve immediately to avoid over-extraction

A French Press is perfect if you:
- Love rich, full-bodied coffee
- Enjoy the ritual of making coffee
- Want an affordable brewing method
- Like to control your coffee strength
