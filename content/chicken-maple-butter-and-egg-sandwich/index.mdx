The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The eggs are light and fluffy. The maple butter adds a hint of sweetness that goes really well with the savory chicken.
And the oat biscuit roll holds it all together in a hearty package.

It's high in protein, which can help keep you full. But it's also pretty high in calories and fat. It's okay as a treat, but there might be better choices for everyday eating if you're watching your calories.

The Starbucks Chicken Maple Butter & Egg Sandwich is a tasty new breakfast option. It's perfect for anyone who wants a filling meal with a mix of flavors. Give it a try next time you're at Starbucks for breakfast!

Remember, while it's yummy, it's also high in calories. Enjoy it as part of a balanced diet.
And remember to pair it with your favorite Starbucks coffee or tea for a complete breakfast experience!
